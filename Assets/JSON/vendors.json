Her interest in contemporary abstract and geometric art started in 2008 with a hard-edge assignment during a high school painting class. Her Golden acrylic paint, 3M blue painter\u2019s tape, and a quilting ruler are now her most cherished tools. Lauren landed her first solo exhibit in 2013 in Chicago and her art-making progressed from there. Greeted with a thriving arts community upon her homecoming to Milwaukee, she's gained exposure in the local market, showing her artwork at bars, boutiques, and galleries. As Lauren\u2019s goals have accelerated toward a full-time career, Lauren spends her free time painting as a creative and therapeutic outlet. Lauren received her MA in Community Arts from Eastern Illinois University in 2019. Her graduate research focused on three primary topics: equitable and inclusive community engagement, maximum learning for under-resourced youth, and the opportunity for progressive, student-centered learning to transform the current landscape of education. Lauren has spent 15 years working with youth of various ages, backgrounds, and abilities, and hopes to use her master\u2019s degree to support multidisciplinary, exploratory, community-based arts opportunities for youth and families.<\/p>",

She is primarily making art within the realms of textiles, painting, mixed media, and sculpture. Faith grew up and spent her early life in rural Central Ohio before moving to Milwaukee to pursue her BFA at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design. Growing up in an environment where she was always surrounded by and had access to nature, she now feels a strong personal connection with the natural world. It is because of this that much of her work is made with nature and the world around us in mind, while also exploring ideas surrounding physicality, tactility, and material exploration. In making her work, Faith is constantly striving to explore what textiles as a medium can do and where they can be pushed farther.",

I wanted us to be a family. I wanted my parents to be together like they were once before. I abandoned that idea a long time ago, the idea of us being the \u201cideal\u201d, family or me being the ideal child. I chose to hide away my feelings and never let them resurface, they had no place in the outside world. Everyone finger painted in elementary school and everyone did a blind drawing or two, but art was more than just another class to me. I begged my parents for more pencils, pens and sketchbooks I wanted to create what I refused to say. Every pencil stroke was like a cut I couldn\u2019t erase, every section I colored was like a wall blocking out the negativity, my tears ran down my face as I finished every picture. My life has become a mural of pain, suffering, redemption and the power to overcome, I made my life into something I never could see for myself. Now every stroke is one of redemption, one of power, one of forgiveness, one of great passion. I learned a lot from my parents. Both good and bad. At the end of the day I see this memory as a gift because I learned to be a quiet observer. I learned to be an artist. As an artist, I have decided to seek out ways to feel proud of the many aspects of myself that other girls like me seem to shy away from. When I think back to that day and think of my mother, I see her strength, it took a strong woman to move past that and raise me. I do not and will never see myself as a victim. I want to communicate, now and to future potential design clients, that sense of self esteem and power. My goal is to reflect dark skin full of rich and glowing melanin, curly coarse black hair that nobody is willing to embrace, and bodies with full hips and lips and curves. I want to be proud of my melanin, to look into the mirror and see a queen staring back at me.",

I am a freshman at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design. I started my career since I have been in high school. In early 2018, I was in a contest for photography through Zip Mke, and in September of 2018, I won and had one of the pictures I had taken featured and permanently displayed in the Fiserv Forum. In 2019, I was one of the students to win an honorable mention for Scholastics Art and Writing Awards, for the Corn Husk dress piece featured. My work is heavily influenced by Mexican culture, and I love the vibrant colours, stories and the richness of the culture itself. I have strong ties to the culture since all of my family was born in Mexico, only me and my sisters are US-born. I am a 1st generation Mexican-American, and I believe it is important for me to embrace my roots. Through my work I like to depict the beauty and richness of the culture, I like to educate those who are not exposed to it and see it as \u201cforeign\u201d. I believe it is more important now to embrace my roots in the heat of the moment as we see the rise of hate and division within the country. I like to deliver a strong message saying, \u201cI am here, I exist, and I\u2019m what makes America too\u201d. Images can have tremendous power, for me, art gives me a voice and it helps me give voices for those who cannot be heard.",

Oliver uses mixed media to achieve the unique imagery of their work. Known for their attention to detail, Oliver's artistry leaves the eye looking for the next aspect of the piece. Their black and white ink works showcase this quality as the viewer identifies each individual stroke of the pen. Often using ink and paint in their art, Hayes develops an array of color that compliments the piece's focal point. You can find their work documented on their instagram",

There is no linear definition to his body of work, as every piece is layered with intricate techniques and philosophical meaning  Throughout Trotters life, he has overcome many obstacles, which are embedded in the foundation of his art pieces. He used his pain as a source of inspiration to create surreal and abstract pieces of work; for the sole purpose of empowering others like him. He has found inspiration from artists Hebru Brantley and Demetrius Harmon; two black men whose art positively inspires the masses while manifesting the struggles of African Americans in America. Like them, Trotter seeks to be a relatable source of hope for his generation. Based on his portfolio, Trotter has been awarded: a position in the Global Classmates Ambassador program where only six students nationwide were selected. Trotter proudly shared with the politicians that his mission was to help change the world through his art; and during his eight days in Washington D.C. his art was displayed and served as a source of conversation for international diplomats and other political figures. Moreover, Trotter has sold numerous art pieces that remain on display at Evanston Township High School. He was awarded the Presidential Scholarship, the highest award granted at Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design, where he currently attends. In addition to these awards, Trotter has attended programs at Chicago Art Institute, Evanston Arts and Cultural Center. Trotter has worked closely alongside artists such as Raymond A. Thomas, Ceazar Perez (Czr Prz) and Khalilah Birdsong to further hone his skills.",

I currently live and reside in Milwaukee,WI as a student at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design. When using photography, I have been focusing on language, conversation, and interaction with, and between, people and objects. I strongly believe language takes the form of text but also visually. I utilize color, angles, and lighting to covey emotion and context to my audience. 'Writing' with a camera is an important way for me to engage with the outside world and navigating language in my everyday life as well.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div><\/blockquote>",

The collaged elements of his artwork become more than the sum of their parts exhibiting a spiritual nature. Born in Chicago in 1988, John Kowalczyk currently lives and works in Milwaukee, WI as an artist who utilizes art as a vehicle towards a more equitable society. He received his BFA in painting from Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design in 2010, and began a three year residency with RedLine Milwaukee soon after, where he curated gallery exhibitions and developed a passion for community art. Since 2017, Kowalczyk has served as the Program Director with the non profit organization Artists Working in Education where he oversees large scale community art projects working with artists, community stakeholders, and youth in Milwaukee. Kowalczyk founded the company Brick and Beauty in 2019 which produces custom visual art experiences and mural work. Kowalczyk\u2019s work has been exhibited at the Sienna Art Institute in Italy, The Charles Allis Art Museum, The Museum of Wisconsin Art, Cedarburg Cultural Center, John Michael Kohler Art Center, and D.Varelli Gallery in Chicago along with other galleries across the U.S. Kowalczyk is represented by Scout Gallery in Milwaukee, WI.",

I primarily work with acrylic paint on canvas but I've been experimenting with incorporating texture and depth into my works lately with things like fabric and yarn. I would say my style is mostly pop-art using bright colors and interesting textures but I have interests in illustration and creative writing as well. In addition to being an artist and team member of TRUE Skool I also have a professional background in marketing. My goal with my works of art, is to continue to grow my skills, process my emotions and spread joy to others.",

Art for me has become about my legacy. I wanted to make pieces that\u2019ll live on after I\u2019m gone. Art that\u2019ll make my daughter proud that her mom made this. Art is a way for me to express all the things I stand for as far as me being black, a woman, a mother and also a Christian. Art allows me to express these things on so many different levels. I have been painting seriously for about 2 years now. It\u2019s very difficult for me to describe my art because once I put my brush to the canvas all of my thoughts just go away. My art is carefree and very open to interpretation. As an upcoming artist in the inner city I take so much pride in just setting my pieces in my front yard and seeing so many people showing interest in my art. I believe pieces of my art are in many homes being taken care of with love. My dream is to paint for as long as I can and to reach as many people as I can.",

I got a little taller and became a more full-time artist between high school and college.\u00a0 My university was a school that specialized in art and architecture, and I graduated from there with a degree in print-making and learned many traditional and modern techniques.\u00a0 After university, I painted murals in Thai temples for a while and then worked as an art teacher and also graphic designer for a big company.\u00a0 Working for a big company was good for the bills, but sometimes it was difficult to make the art that was in your heart. \u00a0 I painted and made the sculptures in this time, had some art shows locally and in Japan, and also opened a manga store in Bangkok.\u00a0 After a lot of ups and downs, life took me across the ocean to a new home. I moved to America 10 years ago and opened up a clothing and Art store and now I am working on starting my own Gallery and shop. Fast forward a bit, add a bunch of hard work and super chilly winters, and now I am a citizen and Milwaukeean! I am working with Black Cat Alley and other mural groups and Im excited to be a part of the community of Art in our city!",

After graduating Harvard University in 2006 Floyd-Pruitt moved his art practice back to Milwaukee, where he grew up. Floyd-Pruitt started rapping and producing music as a youth, taking up the moniker MC Mikal. These early forays into making music led to his first collaborations with other artists. Along with his personal art practice, he is also a community artist and cultural producer. His involvement includes \u201cputting together projects with youth groups, serving as creative consultant on various public art projects, and going into organizations to help them accomplish an idea.\u201d \u201cAs an artist I take a multifaceted approach to creating. I studied filmmaking in college, taught myself to paint, took some screen-printing classes, dabbled in a bit of sculpture, and essentially when I think of something, I try to figure out how to make it,\u201d said Floyd-Pruitt. \u201cIt\u2019s all sort of one creative mash-up for me.\u201d Floyd-Pruitt is currently engaged in hip-hop-focused projects, inspired by such artists as producer J Dilla, and rapper Ghostface Killah, a former member of Wu Tang Klan. His work was featured in a larger installation series exhibited at Jazale\u2019s Art Studio in Bronzeville at the end of 2016. \u201cWe did a series called Art House Trap. The intent was to create a free, intergenerational community event, where people were welcome to experience the creative process and participate in a discussion about hip-hop,\u201d Floyd-Pruitt said. \u201cI have a lot of recording to do, and I\u2019m excited about my next body of work. Hip hop, liberation, jilted youth, I\u2019m about that.\u201d \u201cI also rep I AM MILWAUKEE,\u201d said Floyd-Pruitt, referring to the logo he designed and trademarked. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifestyle brand promoting unity, creativity, pride and ownership in Milwaukee.\u201d The brand offers apparel, and is going to expand soon to develop media to showcase the city\u2019s creativity and talent, he said. \u201cI\u2019m from Milwaukee; I grew up here. After I graduated from college I came back here and to me it\u2019s my home. It\u2019s important to me to see the art market and the culture develop and expand and I think it\u2019s a challenge worth taking on.\u201d -Partial text from an article on Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service by Mitchell Mittelstedt, published on June 5, 2017.",

She enjoys learning new medias and what new challenges that they provoke. She has learned a range of mediums such as, drawing, painting, sculpture and photography, but she always finds her comfort with a canvas and brush in hand. As her education and skills developed more as she grows older, there have always been some common themes in her work, such as duality and phycological elements. One of her favorite subjects to work with, no matter the medium, is the human figure. The nude figure can evoke a psychological connection to an audience and can calm the mind of the artist. As she continues developing her art she will pursue searching for a career in the arts where she will feel most at home.",
